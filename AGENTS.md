## Product boundary

- cphn is a reusable phone-verification cascade: cheapest transport first
  (WhatsApp auth, flash-call, SMS), with explicit user decline handling.
  The library defines ordering, OTP state and opaque dedup; the host
  application owns provider keys, message sending and raw phone handling.
- Raw phone numbers must never enter logs, errors, test fixtures or
  attestation output. Store only HMAC(server_secret, community | E.164)
  for dedup. Deleting raw after verification is hygiene, not blindness:
  a self-operated checker still fails the strict cvld opaque bar where
  an independent provider must retain inputs.
- Phone proves control at a time, not one-human uniqueness. Recycling,
  VoIP/burner policy and re-verification frequency belong in host policy.
- This crate is LGPL-3.0-only WITH LGPL-3.0-linking-exception: combined works
  may link statically or dynamically without relinking duties; library
  modifications stay LGPL. Do not add implementation code available
  only under the full GPL or AGPL.
- No live provider calls in tests. Fixtures only. No spending, registration
  or outreach from this library.

## Quality boundary

- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets` (no warnings),
  `cargo test` — all green before every commit. No local workstation
  builds per task status; use GHA, Crow fallback while GHA is down.
- Validate cascade ordering, constant-time code verify, uniform errors,
  expiry, rate-limit hooks and HMAC domain separation with fixtures.
